# Solar-Explorer-Program
An exploratory game/simulation inspired by "If the Moon Were Only 1 Pixel"

Name
Solar Explorer Program

DESCRIPTION

This project was inspired by the online website https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html
I took my own spin on this project by adding an educational/entertainment aspect to this idea, where you (the spaceship), can visit the major bodies of our Solar System while experiencing the vast size of it. 

I combined my interests of programming and space to create this, and its something that I was quite passionate about when working on it.

VISUALS

As soon as the program runs, you'll be greeted by a homescreen and instruction pages that I designed myself. I utilised some online art and chose to have a pixel/blocky feel as part of the theme.

In the game, there are 14 major places to explore. Some are planets, but there are also objects such as the asteroid belt!
Included are
- Sun
- Mercury
- Venus
- Earth
- Mars
- Asteroid Belt
- Jupiter
- Saturn
- Uranus
- Neptune
- Kuiper Belt
- Pluto
- Start of the Oort Cloud
- End of the Oort Cloud

USAGE

The program utilises basic game controls such as WASD to move around. Further instructions are found in the game.

FEATURES

I've included a basic GUI that displays your current speed in km/s, distance from the leftmost object (AU, which is Astronomical Unit), distance to the next object, and total distance travelled.

The size of the entire space has been scaled down to the point, where as the main idea suggests, each pixel represents the diameter of our moon. This means that each pixel is approximately 3,474 kilometers. Other than the controlled spaceship, all other sites and distances have been scaled to accurately represent this theme!

As for extra features, I tried to improve the feel of flying. To make it somewhat "realistic", I implemented rules such as the ship doesn't slow down when coasting. This represents the idea that there isn't any frictional forces to stop it. The only way to stop is by thrusting in the opposite direction, which is included through my acceleration method.


SUPPORT

This is an old project, but if you do decide to run this or have any questions about it, I can be contacted at leer78@mcmaster.ca.
